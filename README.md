# ASP.NET Zero Boilerplate Admin Backend with Metronic Framework  

This project is a backend application developed using the **ASP.NET Zero Boilerplate** framework, extended with the **Metronic Framework**, and customized for business logic integration. The application includes an extensive **JSON API** to enable communication with external devices, particularly for managing and monitoring charging points for electric vehicles, using the **OCPP protocol**.  

## Features  

1. **User Management**  
   - Multi-tenant architecture.  
   - Role and permission management with granular control.  

2. **Topology Implementation**  
   - Hierarchical structure to organize entities:  
     - **Tenant → End Customer → Country → Region → Installation → Group → Charger → Outlet**.  
   - Supports multi-level permissions and user access control.  

3. **OCPP Protocol Compliance**  
   - Implements **OCPP 1.6** (with provisions for 2.0 in the future).  
   - Manages charging sessions, including start, stop, user tracking, and meter value reporting.  

4. **JSON API for External Integration**  
   - Enables external systems to monitor and control charging points.  
   - Provides real-time updates and history logs for analytical insights.  

5. **Metronic UI Integration**  
   - Responsive and customizable admin dashboard for monitoring and configuration.  
   - Pre-built components to reduce development effort.  

6. **Extensible Design**  
   - Modular structure to add business logic incrementally.  
   - Supports iterative development and agile workflows.

## Project Setup  

### Prerequisites  
- **ASP.NET Core 1.1 or later**  
- **ASP.NET Zero Framework** (licensed version)  
- **Metronic Framework** (licensed version)  
- **SQL Server** for database management.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/aaftab1441/Onyx.git
   cd Onyx  
   ```  
2. Set up the database:  
   - Create a local SQL Server instance.  
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`.  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   dotnet restore  
   ```  

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   dotnet run  
   ```  

5. Access the application:  
   - Backend: `http://localhost:<port>`  
   - API: `http://localhost:<port>/api`

## Development Guidelines  

### Workflow  
- **Repository Management**:  
  - All development work is tracked via a private GitHub repository.  
  - Regular code reviews ensure quality and adherence to best practices.  

- **Database Management**:  
  - Develop locally with SQL Server to reduce latency.  
  - Production databases will be hosted in the target environment.  

- **Communication Protocols**:  
  - Follow **OCPP 1.6/2.0** standards for API interactions.  

### Iterative Development  
- Start with the **topology module**, modeling required tables and ensuring the foundation is robust.  
- Extend features incrementally, aligning with business logic discussions.  

---

## Deployment  

- Deploy the app in a staging environment within the client’s infrastructure for testing.  
- Host the database in the designated environment after finalizing the local testing phase.  

---

## Future Enhancements  

- Integration of OCPP 2.0 for enhanced security and protocol extensions.  
- Advanced analytics and reporting features for usage insights.  
- Enhanced permission mechanisms for finer data-level access control.
